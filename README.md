# Cryptocurrency Price Prediction using Python 
 Predicting the price of cryptocurrencies is one of the popular case studies in the data science community. The prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies don't just depend on the number of people who buy or sell them. Today. the change in the prices of these investments also depends on the changes in the financial policies of the government regarding any cryptocurrency. The feelings of people towards a particular cryptocurrency or personality who directly or indirectly endorse a cryptocurrency also result in a huge buying and selling of a particular cryptocurrency, resulting in a change of prices. Using machine learning for cryptocurrency price prediction can only work in situations where price changes due to historical prices that people see before buying and selling cryptocurrency. In this project we will see how we can predict the bitcoin prices for the next 30 days.
